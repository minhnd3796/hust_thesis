\chapter*{Thesis Summary}
The content of this thesis is divided into 5 chapters as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Chapter 1 presents brief introduction to remote sensing, aerial
  photography and semantic segmentation problem as well as 2D Semantic
  Labelling Contest by International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote
  Sensing.
  \item Chapter 2 indicates the basic knowledge of machine learning and deep
  learning generally, delves a bit deeper in detail in terms of deep learning
  in computer vision with its application to solve general classification task.
  \item Chapter 3 proposes several deep learning models for solving semantic
  segmentation problem in the 2D Semantic Labelling Contest with detailed
  implementation.
  \item Chapter 4 announces experimental results in both validation and test
  phases with the submission results from International Society for
  Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.
\end{enumerate}
