\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to my supervisor,
Dr Dinh Viet Sang. His genuine will to conduct research has become my great
source of inspiration to pursue my academic career in the future.
Dr Sang has helped me a lot by not only delivering academic knowledge and
teaching essential research skills but also shaping up my perspective about
how to be a good researcher. Thus, I am specially grateful to be one of his
students.


In addition, I would like to express my gratitude to every teacher in the
Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology program, School of Information
Technology and Communication - Hanoi University of Science and Technology for
broadening my fundamental knowledge and providing me with priceless vocational
experiences those which would be essential for my future life and career.


Last but not least, I would like to thank all of my bosses, colleagues and my
teammates in Human-Machine Intelligence and Vision teams at FPT Technology
Research Institute - FPT University, who have always been whole-heartedly
supporting and providing me with supports and significant computational
resources upon completing this thesis.


Finally, with utmost respect, I would like to express my greatest gratitude to
my parents in my family for they have always offered solid support and the most
favourable conditions for my education and successes.
