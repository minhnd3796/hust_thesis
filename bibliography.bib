@book{citeulike:4129109,
    abstract = {Since the publication of the first edition in the 1940s, the
    Manual of Photogrammetry has served as the comprehensive reference for
    those working in the field of photogrammetry and for those in other fields
    who need to use or understand photogrammetric applications. Recent years
    have seen fundamental changes in photogrammetric theory and practice, due
    both to technological changes such as the widespread adoption of digital
    imagery, and also the emergence of separate fields with strong
    photogrammetric components, such as geographic information systems,
    computer vision and remote sensing. The Fifth Edition of the Manual
    provides a guide to photogrammetric practice at the start of the 21st
    century, integrating new sensors, exploitation techniques and products
    into the ever-evolving practice of photogrammetry. Positioning
    technologies, such as {GPS} and inertial navigation systems, have reduced
    ground control survey costs, while simultaneously reducing the need for
    ground control surveys by making direct sensor orientation possible. New
    platforms and sensors, including digital sensors on both airborne and
    satellite platforms, have become standard alternatives to aerial film
    data capture. Fully-digital production lines, from acquisition to
    exploitation, have become the norm. The Internet now allows production
    to be distributed across the world and final products to be disseminated
    almost instantaneously. Digital elevation models are now routinely
    produced using lidar and ifsar, without traditional stereo imagery. The
    practice of photogrammetry now requires familiarity with all these
    technologies and more. The outline of this edition attempts to reflect
    the new structure of the field. The emphasis is on digital methods and
    products, although the rapidly changing technology precludes the detailed
    description of operating procedures and software. There is much more
    mathematical content than in the previous edition, particularly in
    projective geometry and statistics, and discussions of digital image
    processing and computer vision algorithms to provide insight into digital
    production operations. It is hoped that this will provide background for
    many of the new automated exploitation techniques now being introduced, and
    also serve as an entry point for those from other fields who will use this
    book as a reference.},
